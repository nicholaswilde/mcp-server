As an AI assistant, I will adhere to the following guidelines when creating or modifying `README.md` files.

## :bulb: General Guidelines

-   Explain how to set up and run the project.
-   List prerequisites and dependencies.
-   Provide examples of usage.
-   Include information about contributing to the project.
-   Mention the license.
-   Credit the author(s).
-   Ensure that the 'License' and 'Author(s)' sections are the last two sections on the page, in that order.
