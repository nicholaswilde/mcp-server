# Cloud Best Practices for Agents

This document outlines general cloud best practices that agents should adhere to when interacting with multi-cloud environments. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, efficiency, and reliability in operations.

## 1. Resource Tagging

**Importance**: Consistent and comprehensive resource tagging is crucial for cost allocation, resource management, automation, and security. Tags allow for easy identification and categorization of resources.

**Guidelines**:
*   Apply tags to all provisioned resources.
*   Use a standardized tagging schema across all cloud providers.
*   Common tags include `Project`, `Environment` (dev, staging, prod), `Owner`, `CostCenter`, `Application`.

## 2. Naming Conventions

**Importance**: Clear and consistent naming conventions improve readability, reduce confusion, and simplify automation and scripting.

**Guidelines**:
*   Establish a naming convention for all resource types (e.g., `proj-env-app-resourcetype-id`).
*   Use lowercase characters, hyphens as separators, and avoid special characters.
*   Keep names concise but descriptive.

## 3. Cost Optimization

**Importance**: Efficiently managing cloud costs is vital. Agents should be aware of cost implications and strive to optimize resource usage.

**Guidelines**:
*   Identify and terminate idle or underutilized resources.
*   Right-size resources to match actual workload requirements.
*   Consider using reserved instances or savings plans for predictable workloads.
*   Leverage serverless and managed services where appropriate to reduce operational overhead and cost.
*   Refer to the `cost_optimizer.sh` script for automated cost analysis and recommendations.

## 4. High Availability and Fault Tolerance

**Importance**: Designing for high availability and fault tolerance ensures applications remain accessible and resilient to failures.

**Guidelines**:
*   Distribute resources across multiple availability zones or regions.
*   Implement auto-scaling to handle varying loads.
*   Utilize load balancers to distribute traffic.
*   Design for graceful degradation and quick recovery from failures.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting

**Importance**: Robust monitoring and alerting systems are essential for understanding application performance, identifying issues, and ensuring timely responses.

**Guidelines**:
*   Collect metrics and logs from all critical resources and applications.
*   Set up appropriate alerts for anomalies, errors, and performance thresholds.
*   Ensure alerts are actionable and routed to the correct teams.
*   Refer to the `monitor_logs.sh` and `health_check.sh` scripts for automated log retrieval and health checks.
